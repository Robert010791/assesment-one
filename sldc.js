// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step the requirements of the software are detrimined as well as what will be needed for the software to operate."
const design = "This will be how the user interacts with the software."
const testingAndIntegration = "this will be testing the software to make sure noting is broken and that it works the way we want."
const implementation = "Project is complete and is being shipped out to the user"
const maintain = "Keeping the software up to date. Fixing any issues missed in testing and keeping software secure."
